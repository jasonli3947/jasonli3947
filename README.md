ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I am Buyang Li

I'm an experienced data scientist with a demonstrated history of working in the analytics consulting industry. I have 7 years of experience in the financial domain working with consulting firms and providing expertise in financial analysis, statistical analysis, predictive modeling, machine learning, process optimization, and data visualization. I am skilled in analyzing large datasets in Python, R, SQL, SAS, and Excel, generating recommendations, and presenting them to the stakeholders through visuals in Microsoft PowerPoint and Tableau.

I am passionate about problems that can be solved through data, and I get excited by all such unexplored possibilities in our tech-driven world. Throughout my four years of work experience, I have been fascinated by how much a group of people can achieve through a structured project and the first questions I ask when I start working on a new business problem are "Why is this problem important?", and "What's the best way we can tackle this as a group?". I am always looking for opportunities where I can enhance my Data Analytics/Data Science Skills.
